Error checking is done by InputProcessor and PictureProcessor. These classes serve as barricades to the rest of the program.
They analyze the input to make sure the rest of the program cannot enter a bad state.

From the processors, they call Writer's writeError method upon error. This method will log the erroneous input and throw a RuntimeException.
 We throw an IllegalArgumentException as this method is only called when the input cannot be interpreted. Further,
 we throw an exception to kill the program as we cannot redeem the outcome (we want to be accurate). A runtime exception is used
 so we do not have to bubble up the exception to the processors.

 I would have logged a more descriptive error, but we are only supposed to output "Error."
